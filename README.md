This task is not large but includes all the elements of Angular and is designed to test the candidate's ability to use them properly for application development. The task must be performed accurately without workarounds because the goal is to test the way and not just the result. The design capabilities are not tested in this task, so you can use auxiliary libraries such as bootstrap, material and more.
The topics examined are:

+ Correct and efficient division into components
+ Using ngrx technology for state management
+ Routing + lazy loading of modules
+ Working with forms using the Reactive Forms Module
+ Proper use of Observables
+ Understanding of component life cycle
+ Working with a backend
